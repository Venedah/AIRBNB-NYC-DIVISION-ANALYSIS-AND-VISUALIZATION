# TITLE OF PROJECT- AIRBNB-NYC-DIVISION-ANALYSIS-AND-VISUALIZATION

## DESCRIPTION
> In this project, I performed exploratory analysis on the AIRBNB NYC Divisions Host Listings. Visualzations include;
  1. Top 10 hosts on AIRBNB in NYC
  2. Host listings across the NYC Neighborhood Divisions.
  3. Price distribution across different neighbourhoods which include;
      i.Brooklyn
      ii.Queens
      iii.Manhattan
      iv. Staten Island
      v.Bronx
  4. Price distributions across room types which include;
    i. Private room
    ii. Shared room
    iii. Entire home/apartment.
   
 > After analysis and visualizations, we concluded that:
    i.Manhattan is the most expensive region, with 196.88 as a mean value.
    ii.Bronx is the less expensive region, with 87.50 as a mean value.
    iii.Entire home/apt is the most expensive room type with 211.79.
